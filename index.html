                            I face challenges always displaying strong strong work ethics. I am looking to transition
                            into
                            the

                        <p class="mb-0">I have a multicultural background and I'm fully bilingual. Born and raised in
                            Argentina,
                            my
                            first language is Spanish. My family and I moved out of the country and had the opportunity
                            to
                            live
                            in
                            Mexico City and San Jose, Costa Rica. We came to the U.S. in 2009 and now recently became a
                            US
                            Citizen.
                            I live in Denver, CO and have worked for other Tech companies like Apple. I enjoy working
                            withing a
                            team
                            setting and meeting people from all cultures and lifestyles. I am excited to begin a new
                            career
                            path
                            in
                            Web Development, and I'm looking forward to using my current skills and applying them to new
                            challenges.
